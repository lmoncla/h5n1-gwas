    "# Analyze mutations on host switch branches\n",
    "\n",
    "As another test for host-switching associated mutations, I would like to do this branch test to determine whether there are mutations that are associated specifically with cross-species transmission events. In this notebook, I will do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each branch on the tree, determine whether it is part of a host switch or not. A branch is part of a host switch if it's host state is different from its parent host state, or if it's child branch is a different host state than it is. \n",
    "2. If the branch is part of a host switch, categorize whether it is the parent or child branch. In this mascot model with the migration events mapped onto individual branches, what you end up with is for host switch branches, 2 branches of distinct host states that are continuous. So for example, the parent branch will have one child, which is the portion of the entire branch which is a different host state. \n",
    "3. Enumerate whether there are any mutations on the branch. "
